# MNIST-AI
Artificial Feedforward neural network coded in pure java (no libraries used). This is an application I've developed from the training process that visualises the performance. The network is not perfect by any means. It has an accuracy of 91.7% which is good but no great. This is because my architectrue (784,16,16,10) is imperfect and is unoptimised for training. The model used in the visualisation tool is was trained using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. Note: due to misundersatnding, my model wasn`t trained using traditional epochs, instead each iteration just chooses random test data (of the mini-batch size). To run, unzip the zipped folder. Simply, run the jar file in that unzipped folder. Enjoy!
